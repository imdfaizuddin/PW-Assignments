Task 5 : Explain Z index

The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.

An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.

Note: z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) and flex items (elements that are direct children of display:flex elements)

Example:

img {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0px;
  top: 0px;
  z-index: -1;
}

The code above will put the image on top of any element at that position with a lower z-index value.
