The var() function in CSS is used to reference and use the value of a custom property (also known as a CSS
variable) within your stylesheets. CSS variables are defined using the -- prefix followed by a variable name.
They allow us to store and reuse values throughout our stylesheet, making it easier to maintain consistency and
make global changes.

Using the var() function offers several benefits:

1) Centralized style management: CSS variables allow you to define and manage styles in a centralized location, making it easier to change 
and update styles across a website or application.

2) Improved maintainability: By using variables for commonly used colors, font sizes, and other styling values, the code becomes more 
maintainable and easier to understand.

3) Theme switching: CSS variables can be used to implement theme switching, allowing users to change the overall appearance of a website or 
application by simply changing the values of the defined variables.

4) Dynamic styling: The var() function can be used with dynamic values, such as calculations or data from JavaScript, to create more dynamic 
and responsive styles.

5) Reusability: CSS variables can be reused throughout a codebase, promoting consistency and reducing the need for repetitive code.
